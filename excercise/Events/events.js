//eventlistener, how to listen to them, how to do stuff when things happens. So DOM elements (things that's on the page) 
//they emit events when they're clicked, when there are hovered, when there are dragged, they will start to fire of they will emit events 
//when they are interacted with. We can use eventlistener to use it when it happen and do something and react to them
//so you can attach listener to all elements and you also can attach them to the document as well as the window
const butts = document.querySelector('.butts');
const coolButton = document.querySelector('.cool');
const buyButtons = document.querySelectorAll('button.buy');
const hoorey = () => console.log('HOOREY');

console.log(butts);

function handleClicked() {
    console.log('it got clicked');
}

function buyItem(){
    console.log('Buying Itlem');
}

function attachListener(buyButton){
    console.log('Binding the buy button');
    buyButton.addEventListener('click', buyItem)
}

butts.addEventListener('click', hoorey);
coolButton.addEventListener('click', handleClicked);

//there are 3 steps! 1.go get something 2.listen for something 3.go ahead and do something.
//callback function is a  regular function. It's a word we use to describe a function we pass to a method
//that will then be called a later point of time but instead us calling the function, we provide a name or reference to a function to addEventListener
//and then the browser will take care of calling or running that function for us when it needs to 
//it similars to say sort of like "hey browser, I made this function, when somebody click on my butt button, can you please do me a favor and run for me, thank you:)"

butts.removeEventListener('click', handleClicked); //binding = taking a funciton and listening for a specific click aginst the element

//listen to multiple items : in order to attach addeventlistener in multiple item, you need to loop in individually.
// we can use foreach to loop each item which will run the funciton of foreach of the node item.

buyButtons.forEach(attachListener);
